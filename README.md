For the role playing game _Das schwarze Auge_ (DSA), it is not easy to
guess from the stat values and the modifiers the effective probabilities
for success. With this perl script, these probabilities can be calculated.

You can use the script either on a case-by-case bases by specifying
the 3 stat values and modifiers, or you can output a table which can
then be typeset with LaTeX.
